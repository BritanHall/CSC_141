If I had infinite Python skills, I would like to know how to hack for ethical reasons. It would be very interesting to know 
how to reverse-hack scammers and anyone trying to cause harm to those who simply don't understand. I would also like to help
make software that better protects people from malware and online attacks. I think it would be of great help to a lot of people who 
spend time online to use free software that is easy to use and truly protective against malware.

Another project I would like to work on is building my own game. I have found a lot of inspiration from indie developers. I enjoy 
playing these games and can feel how much creativity and thought went into them. I enjoy being creative, and developing a game 
from scratch seems to interest me. I canâ€™t say what the game would be about, as I play and enjoy a variety of games.

I've always loved doing puzzles and complex problems where you can use your creativity to solve them. For instance, I first 
discovered this interest while working with a group of students on a K'Nex competition. We were tasked with building a machine to 
pick up and move a block. I believe computer science is the perfect combination of my passions for computers and problem-solving.
