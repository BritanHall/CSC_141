If I could make anything in code I would make a 2D hack and slash/roguelike game. I find a lot
fun playing them and think it would be interesting to make one myself.  Examples of these types
of games include 'Dead Cells' and 'Hades'.  I really enjoy playing a simple game loop that is
easy to understand yet hard to master. I think through all of the time I have spent playing these
I could also make a decent try at one of these. I would make the gameplay and fighting mechanics 
super smooth with quirky and fun 2D player models and bright enviroment.
